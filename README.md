This was just a dumb shitpost in the CAFE discord, but something possessed me to make it real.  Here it is, folks:
Double Edge implemented in Minecraft.  Maybe some more game mechanics later, if I ever decide to make a real ffxiv mod.

This is my first time making a Fabric mod so the code quality is gonna be awful.  The usual stuff.  It's also janky as
anything - I handle DE stacks by a scoreboard objective for the player rather than any real encapsulation.  That's all
part of the charm, I swear!
